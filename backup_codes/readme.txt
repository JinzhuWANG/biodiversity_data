Here are backup code to calculate biodiversity contributions from each landuse type.


Reasons of not using these code:
    - Codes here need to warp dvars (1D vector, num. 334) to 2D map, which is expensive computation.
    - The parallelising functions are very complicated when migrating these code to LUTO main project.
